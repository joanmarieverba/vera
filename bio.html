        <p><b>Vera Nazarian</b> is arguably the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span> Armenian-Russian
            professional speculative fiction writer working in English today.</p>
   
        <p>Her life story is an unusual journey. She left the former Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War as a refugee at
            the age of eight, with her parents and nothing but a <a href="http://www.veranazarian.com/people/self.htp"><b>couple
                    of suitcases</b></a>, and arrived in the United States in 1976, a month before her 10th birthday, by way of
            Lebanon, Greece, and Italy.</p>
        <p>Settling in the United States, she graduated from <a href="http://www.immaculateheart.org/"><b>Immaculate Heart High
                    School</b></a> in Hollywood, CA in 1984, and then attended <a href="http://www.pomona.edu/"><b>Pomona
                    College</b></a> in Claremont, CA, where she double-majored in English and Psychology. She received her B.A.
            in 1988 and soon after went on to work for over a decade in the high tech industry.</p>
        <p>Holding down a full-time tech job by day, she would come home to begin her evening job, that of a professional
            fantasy and science fiction writer and <a href="http://www.sff.net/people/vera.nazarian/art.htp"><b>artist</b></a>
            and <a href="http://www.sff.net/people/vera.nazarian/music.htp"><b>musician</b></a>. Sleep was for wimps!</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Writing Credits and Honors</b></span></p>
        <p>Writing came soon in Vera Nazarian's life — as soon as she figured out the English language, she started to write in
            it, <a href="http://www.sff.net/people/vera.nazarian/write.htp"><b>wrote and dreamed</b></a> all through elementary,
            junior high and high school, and sold her first short story at the age of 17 to the second volume of <a
                href="http://www.mzbworks.com/"><b>Marion Zimmer Bradley's</b></a> popular DAW anthology series <b>Sword and
                Sorceress</b>.</p>
        <p>Since then she has published numerous works of short fiction in anthologies and magazines such as the <b>Sword and
                Sorceress</b> and <b>Darkover</b> anthology series edited by the late <b>Marion Zimmer Bradley</b>, bestselling
            author of the classic Arthurian novel <a

        <p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Citizenship</b></span></p>
        <p>After many years without a country, Vera Nazarian is proud to be a <a
                href="http://www.veranazarian.com/people/citizen.htp"><b>United States Citizen</b></a>.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Themes</b></span></p>
        <p>Ancient myth, moral fables, eclectic philosophy, and her Armenian and Russian ethnic heritage play a strong part in
            all her work, combining the essences of things and places long gone into a rich evocation of wonder.</p>
        <p>Languages also figure prominently in her experience. Vera is a native speaker of Russian and Armenian, is fluent in
            Spanish, and has studied Mandarin Chinese and German. And yet, English is her language of choice when it comes to
            writing.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Current Work in Progress</b></span></p>
        <p>Vera Nazarian is currently at work on a number of book-length projects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>LADY OF MONCHROME</b> — Sequel to <b>LORDS OF RAINBOW</b> which will make it a trilogy. Unlike the epic-scale
                grand fullfillment theme of the first book, the sensibility here is that of the homecoming last portion of
                <i>Jane Eyre</i> and <i>The Odyssey</i> in a high-fantasy world, mixing in politics and culture clash.
                <i>(Complete outline of book one available.)</i> Book three will be titled <b>ARCH OF MANY HUES</b>, with the
                sensibilities of the movie <i>Mr. and Mrs. Smith</i>.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Airealm</b> — Science fantasy trilogy about a world of no land, only sky, and the people who live on the
                floating debris in the Boundlessness — and where the Power of Up and Down (the force of gravity) is manipulated
                like magic. Books One, Two and Three are <b>AIREALM, FLUCTUATION</b>, and <b>STABILITY</b>. <i>(First three
                    chapters and complete outline of book one available, plus trilogy outline.)</i></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><b>GODS OF THE COMPASS ROSE</b> — Another standalone book in the <b>Compass Rose</b> ancient fantasy world
                milieu. A mythic-philosophical puzzle is revealed through mysteriously connected stories in the vein of <i>The
                    One Thousand and One Nights.</i></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><b>The Adventures of Ruricca NoOnesDaughter</b> — Fantasy trilogy chronicling the magical adventures of her
                popular waif-wisewoman character <a href="http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook1975.htm"><b>Ruricca
                        NoOnesDaughter</b></a>. Book one, currently in progress, is <b>THE HANGED WOMAN</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Margot Phoenix Quartet</b> — Four-book kickass paranormal romance series about female heroine <b>Margot
                    Phoenix</b>, an Elemental with powers over the four elements Air, Earth, Water, and Fire (not to mention
                hydrogen, oxygen, copper, zinc, and everything else in the Periodic Table), and who — like Buffy, Anita Blake,
