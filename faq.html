        <p><em><strong> Q: What is your official policy on Fan Fiction
                        (Fanfic)? </strong></em></p>

        <p><strong> A: </strong> I am absolutely honored and pleased that you are enjoying my
            characters, stories, and books so much that you are inspired by them to want to write a fanfic. It really is a
            genuine joy and compliment for an author to find out their work touched the readers so much that they want to
            actively participate in it and explore it further!</p>
        <p>Officially, for creative and legal reasons, I may <strong> 
                        <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;">not</span> </strong>  read it, or see it, or
            even comment on it, especially while I am still working on that particular series and it is still incomplete. But I
            totally appreciate your effort -- as long as you follow these simple rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Include a disclaimer that your fanfic is based on, inspired by, and is using my characters and world / stories /
                books / series, etc. (in other words, it is derived from my copyrighted intellectual property). For example:
                <em> "This fanfic is based on and inspired by QUALIFY: The Atlantis Grail by Vera
                        Nazarian." </em></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't try to make money from it in any way (such as try to sell your fanfic story online, or otherwise illegally
                profit from my hard work -- you may not do this since it is both unethical and against the law).</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Don’t post your fanfic in any official TAG websites, forums, groups or other TAG-affiliated places where I can see it.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Finally, I do ask you hold off a little and wait before posting any fanfic anywhere online, until more of the
                books in that particular series are published (at least two books should be enough), or the series is close to
                complete.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After that, go for it! And thanks so much for being honorable and classy enough to care to ask!</p>

        <p><em><strong> Q: I love your work, and want to spread the word about it! How do I join
                        your Street Team? </strong></em></p>
        <p><strong> A: </strong> Stay tuned! I will have a web page set up with more
            information on the Street Team, coming soon!  Please check this space later! Meanwhile, come on down to <a
                href="http://atlantisgrail.proboards.com/"><strong>The Atlantis Grail Fan Forum</strong></a>, for exciting
            discussions of this series with other fans!</p>
        <p><a name="Q5"></a></p>
        <p><em><strong> Q: May I send you my book, story, or other work-in-progress to read,
                        review, or critique? </strong></em></p>
        <p><strong> A: </strong> I am sorry, no. I am overworked, and my policy is not to
            critique the work of people I don't know. As a general rule I also do not review the works of other authors in
            similar genres, due to a possible conflict of interest.</p>
        <p><a name="Q6"></a></p>
        <p><em><strong> Q: Would you publish my book though Norilana Books? Can I send it to you
                        for consideration? </strong></em></p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Sorry, no. Norilana Books is permanently closed to submissions. Anything you send will be
            ignored, returned unopened, or discarded. To reiterate, this is a firm "no." Feel free to check the <a
                title="Norilana Books" href="http://norilana.com/"><strong>publisher website</strong></a> for status updates,
            but this is not going to change.</p>
        <p><a name="Q7"></a></p>
        <p><em><strong> Q: Would you please provide an author quote or blurb endorsement for the
                        cover jacket of my upcoming book? </strong></em></p>
        <p><strong> A: </strong> I don't know if I can. It depends on my time availability,
            and whether or not I honestly like your work. However, feel free to ask me, and I will give you a specific answer,
            on a case by case basis.</p>
        <p><a name="Q8"></a></p>
        <p><strong><em> Q: I love <a href="http://norilana.com/norilana-anniversary.htm"> your book cover designs</a>! 
            I want to hire you to design my next ebook cover or paper print cover. How much do you charge?</strong></em></p>
        <p><strong> A: </strong> Sure, just ask me, on a case by case basis. I am always open
            to book cover design work inquiries, but if I am overbooked or otherwise unable to do a cover on your schedule, I
            will let you know. I normally charge a flat fee of $100 for an ebook cover, and $200 for a full wraparound jacket or
            full cover flat for paper print books from an InDesign template. Let's talk. <em>(Note -- due to health issues I am
                no longer able to do book covers, so please don't ask.)</em></p>
        <p><a name="Q9"></a></p>
        <p><em><strong> Q: I would like to get an autographed copy of one of your books. How do I
                        do that? </strong></em></p>
        <p><div><strong> A: </strong> The best way to do it is send me the book(s) you want
            autographed (with return postage) to:</div><br />
        <div class="address">
            Vera Nazarian <br />  Norilana
