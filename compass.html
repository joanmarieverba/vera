        <p>The <strong><span style="color: #000000;">Compass Rose</span></strong> universe -- an ancient milieu where places
            have no names, cities spring forth like bouquets in the desert, gods and dreams walk the scorching sands in the
            South, ice floats like mirror shards upon the Northern sea, islands that do not exist are found in the East, death
            chases a thief on the rooftops of a Western city, immortal love spans time, and directions are intertwined into one
            road we all travel....</p>
        <p><strong><em><span style="color: #800000;">You come to this place when you wonder, and sometimes, only when you dream.

        <p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b><i>Praise for Dreams of the Compass Rose</i></b></span></p>
        <p>"...a clever concoction of vignettes and short stories knitted into a morality tale about the temptation of illusion
            and the price of truth.... an exotic setting reminiscent of Tanith Lee's Flat Earth series.... The author's
            sumptuous language will resonate with Lord Dunsany and Clark Ashton Smith fans.... Nazarian's vital themes and
            engaging characters are sure to entertain."<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b><i>— Publishers
                        Weekly</i></b></span></p>
        <p>"Nazarian's story cycle treads the borderline between the episodic novel and the short-story collection, recalling
            the work of contemporary fantasist Charles de Lint, early-twentieth-century fantasist Lord Dunsany, and even,
            reaching way back, <b>The Thousand and One Nights</b>....her imagery is rich, vivid, and memorable, not to mention
            being remarkable because she realizes it not in her native language, Russian, but in English.... Indeed, this is a
            singularly appealing book by a new voice in fantasy."<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>— Roland Green, <i>ALA
                        Booklist</i></b></span></p>
        <p>"...unusual fantasy novel... although it uses many of the trappings of traditional heroic fantasy, the elements are
            assembled in a unique fashion.... Often the conflict is dark and foreboding.... Nazarian's prose is well constructed
            and her exotic settings are vivid and realistic. There's almost a fairy tale quality to the book, and it differs
            enough from the usual array of usurped thrones and quest stories to warrant your time."<br /><span
                style="font-size: large;"><b><i>— Science Fiction Chronicle</i></b></span></p>
        <p>"An intricate multi-level story... a kind of Aesop's Fables... spoken with a voice from the Far East, hypnotic as the
            desert sands."<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b><i>— Locus</i></b></span></p>
        <p>"This is a novel to be read and reread in small doses as pieces of the puzzle are put together."<br /><span
                style="font-size: large;"><b><i>— The Denver Post</i></b></span></p>
        <p>"Vera Nazarian is a fervent prose poet; her first novel, <b>Dreams of the Compass Rose</b>, is a feast of baroque
            colour and eloquence echoing and rivalling Lee's remarkable arabesque cycle, the five-volume <b>Tales of the Flat
                Earth</b>.... <b>Dreams</b> may well become a landmark in the architectonics of the fantastic.... a fierce and
            stylish statement of innovative purpose in a genre that needs shaking up. Fortunately, with Vera Nazarian joining
            the reforming crusade of such fantasists as China Miéville, Jeff VanderMeer, Kelly Link, and Jeffrey Ford, an
            earthquake seems imminent..."<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>— Nicholas Gevers, <i><a
                            href="http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/compassroserev.htm">Infinity Plus</a></i></b></span>
        </p>
        <p>"Vera Nazarian is faithful, in her own way, to the storyteller tradition. Her stories have the same sense of
            mysteries being revealed, and often producing more mysteries, that myth and folk tales do. Her prose tends toward
            the peculiar combination of exotic and generic detailing found in fairy tales. She keeps her vocabulary and her
            setting pre-industrial. Her world is filled with timeless lands, endless deserts, unfathomable abysses. Slaves,
            kings, nomads, warlords, mages, sea captains, and gods all tangle in quests of conquest and journeys of
            discovery."<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>— Eugene Reynolds, <i>The New York Review of Science
                        Fiction</i></b></span></p>
        <p>"...a sweeping, lyrical style that nevertheless contains touches of earthiness.... It may well be that Vera Nazarian,
            like her trickster goddess, Ris, is one of the old masters of fantasy, returned to earth in a new guise. She bears
            watching."<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>— A. L. Sirois</b>, <i><b>Deep Outside SFFH</b></i></span></p>
        <p>"Vera Nazarian has captured a rare and special kind of beauty.... Each story is a gem in itself, a self-contained
            modern myth with a certain unique flavor. It's as though the lands of the Thousand and One Nights had collided with
            the worlds of L. Frank Baum, producing a story cycle with an Ozian undertone and an Arabian accent. Take one story
            at a time, and savor the rich language, the images, and the archetypical characters which populate it. Read them
            all, and trace the patterns of man vs god, truth vs illusion, reality vs legend, appearing over and over in
            different guises."<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>— Michael M. Jones</b>, <i><b>The Green Man
                        Review</b></i></span></p>
        <p>"Nazarian's writing is a banquet for readers who savor fluid language."<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>—
                    Charlene Brusso</b>, <i><b>Black Gate</b></i></span></p>
        <p>"It can be said that all stories are dreams, through some are more real than others. It is the measure of a writer to
            take a tale of wonder and make it honest, with the marvel of fantasy and the keenness of actuality. So Vera Nazarian
            does in her astonishing work <b>Dreams Of The Compass Rose</b>. This master storyteller takes us to a world of
            beauty and harshness, love and cruelty, covering all from light to dark."<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>—
                    Colleen Cahil,</b> <a href="http://sfrevu.com/Review-id.php?id=2186"><b><i>SFRevu.com</i></b></a></span></p>
        <p>"If you took the entire oeuvre of Tanith Lee, melted it down, and shot it up, you'd have the experience of this
            book."<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>— Allison Lonsdale</b></span></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">From the book jacket:</span></strong></p>
        <p>"The colorful strong writing style that Vera has worked on for years has come to full fruition."<br /><span
                style="font-size: large;"><b>— Marion Zimmer Bradley</b></span></p>
        <p>"<b>Dreams of the Compass Rose</b> is a rich, exotic blend of high romance and high magic of a kind rarely seen since
            the classic fantasies of Lord Dunsany, James Branch Cabell and Clark Ashton Smith. This is a work not to be gulped
            but savored, but if you do find yourself unable to stop, re-read it slowly enough to taste the truth within the
            poetry."<br /><span style="font-size: large;">— <b>Diana L. Paxson</b></span>, author of <i><b>Hallowed Isle</b></i>
        </p>
        <p>"I love this book. <b>Dreams of the Compass Rose</b> is a story-cycle in which we keep coming back to the same
            characters, except from different viewpoints and different times in their lives. It's set in a land of desert
            empires that never was, though it could easily be our world -- far in the future, or deep in the past. Some of the
            stories are brutal, some are like dreams. All of them are engaging and resonant, creating a new mythology that feels
            so right one might be forgiven for thinking that it's the cultural heritage of some forgotten country or people that
            have been lost to history. It reminded me of those wonderful, dream-laden story-cycles that Clark Ashton Smith and
            Lord Dunsany were writing around the turn of the last century. <b>Dreams of the Compass Rose</b> has a similar
            stately lyricism, a compelling and visionary voice that speaks to the heart of the reader."<br /><span
                style="font-size: large;"><b>— Charles de Lint</b></span></p>
        <p>"Vera Nazarian's Compass Rose leads the reader on a lyrical journey through time and space, while her compelling and
            kaleidoscopic tale of multiple lives intersecting about a common point explores some of human nature's most basic
            truths."<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>— Jane S. Fancher</b></span>, Author of <i><b>Dance of the
                    Rings</b></i></p>
        <p>"With a glorious richness of language and a use of visual imagery that makes each page like a fireworks display,
            Nazarian has produced a novel that might seem at first glance to be straightforward generic fantasy. But it's not.
            It's far, far more rewarding than that. What she does in <b>Dreams of the Compass Rose</b> is use both old threads
            and new to weave fresh myths -- and vigorous myths at that: there is something almost primal in their power. It is
            rare these days to find a high fantasy that is more than a rehashing of tired themes. <b>Dreams of the Compass
                Rose</b> is one of those rarities -- and a rarity to be treasured. This book breathes the true stuff of
            fantasy."<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>— John Grant</b></span>, Co-Editor of <i><b>The Encyclopedia of
