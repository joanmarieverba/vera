                Zinaida Petrovna Nazarian<br/>
                My beloved mother, kind, generous, warmhearted, long-suffering, enduring, brave, the gentlest, light-filled soul you
                may ever know, died at the age of 82, under hospice care at home in Vermont at 10:22 PM at night on Tuesday (2/3/15)
                after two difficult months of what we thought was a severe, relentless flu and turned out to be leukemia. She
                already survived ovarian cancer in 2007--a year filled with multiple surgeries, complications, infections,
                chemotherapy, hernias, hospital stays--and this time decided that she did not want to go through that again. With
                her passing, the generation of my fathers is now gone.</p>
            <p>Mom was a true survivor. She survived the early days of the Soviet Union, the Nazi occupation of Crimea during World
                War II, not once but twice, as she, a little girl, and my grandmother fled the Germans twice as refugees, all across
                Central Asia and back, riding in freight trains, living homeless underneath an open sky and huddling under blankets
                while getting strafed from overhead by German sniper planes, being rescued and ferried by a battleship in the Black
                Sea, starving among death and dysentery, and finally returning home to Crimea when the war was over, and seeing her
                parents divorce as soon as her father, my grandfather Pyotr Ilyich Ushanov (a captain of a tank division in the Red
                Army) returned from the war a changed man.</p>
            <p>Mom was true old-fashioned Russian, through and through. She grew up in Simferopol, Crimea, living with her
                now-divorced mother, my grandmother Antonina Ivanovna Dementieva (who was the equivalent of the town mayor of
                Simferopol, a high ranking position) and became a teacher of Russian Language and Literature. She taught the
                equivalent of older high school and adult lectures, in Simferopol and other local regions of Crimea including
                military officers schools, in a tiny village school in Siberia, and eventually in Moscow.</p>
            <p>Mom was cultured, refined and always in pursuit of knowledge and learning, an expert in classics of world literature
                and history. She did her final graduation thesis on Jack London, and I remember when I visited Oakland, CA for the
                first time, Mom told me with reverence to look out for things related to him. All my love of language and reading I
                owe to Mom, who imbued my soul with myth, imagery, and literature.</p>
            <p>When she lived in Moscow, studying to apply to the equivalent of graduate school, she met my Dad, Georgii (George)
                Nazarian, an Armenian from Tbilisi, Georgia, in the Moscow Library, of all places. They married and she stayed in
                Moscow permanently, until the mid seventies when we immigrated to the West, leaving the USSR as refugees to Lebanon.
            </p>
            <p>This was when Mom got to survive her second war, the civil war in Lebanon, and be a refugee yet again as we fled with
                other Armenian families to Greece, and finally the United States, where after a long and arduous process she became
                a Permanent Resident and then a US Citizen (among other things, she had to get fingerprinted more than eight times
                by the INS, because her fingerprints were nearly non-existent, the normal whorl patterns worn off the tips of her
                fingers from a lifetime of doing hot water laundry by hand, as all other Russian women of the time.)</p>
            <p>Mom was always reading one book or another, mostly classics in Russian (or Russian translation) and in English. When
                I was a little girl, she originally thought and hoped I would be a literature teacher too, but I turned out a writer
                instead, with many thanks to her, thus staying true to the general notion, and working within the field of literary
                pursuits. She even named me “Vera” (which means “Faith” in Russian), for her favorite female literary character
                Vera, from Ivan Goncharov's <em>The Precipice</em>. (Even now I want to ask Mom a specific detail about this book,
                and turn, and realize she is not there; I can no longer do that, I can never ask her about anything ever again...)
            </p>

                    width="228" height="300" data-wp-pid="1021" /><br />Although she claimed she was not a writer herself, at one point
                many years later, when we were living in Winnetka, California, Mom tried creative writing, and wrote, among other
                things, in Russian, a novella-length variation of Jane Austen's <em>Persuasion</em>, her favorite Austen novel! She
                chose to write about Captain Wentworth traveling on a ship, heartbroken and thinking of his lost love. In Mom's
                story, Wentworth looks out into the ocean and encounters a mermaid, whose lovely dialogue with him convinces him to
                return to seek Anne Elliot's love once more—a beautiful, heart-wrenching, haunting, and well written fantasy novella
                that I just might publish under Mom's own name in Russian, one of these days!</p>
            <p>In addition to literature, Mom loved classical music, especially symphonies and orchestral music, and classical
                Russian Ballet. Back in Russia, she grew up listening to symphonies on the early radio programs. And later here in
                the US, we would always watch ballets and performances on PBS. Art and architecture was also a great love, and Mom
                enjoyed museums and art galleries whenever possible.</p>
            <p><img src="./images/Mom-Hat1-1024x709.jpg" alt="Mom-Hat1"
                    width="300" height="207" data-wp-pid="1022" /><br/>She'd dreamed of traveling the world, and got her wish in part,
                when we became immigrants. At one amazing point, when we were refugees being bused in Greece from the Sounion coast
                to the Athens medical center where they ran the required exams on us before allowing entrance to the US, we drove
                right past the Acropolis. Mom and I started to scream in awe and excitement, pointing and saying, “That's the
                Parthenon!” until other refugees on the bus were asking, “What, what?” and looking at us like we were crazy. We
                never had a chance to get closer to the great temple, but that moment will stay with me always. We were this close
                to it, but were not allowed to leave the bus. Classical Ancient Greece, our impossible dream, so near yet just out
                of reach....</p>
            <p>It's interesting to note that Mom's name, “Zinaida” means “Daughter of Zeus” in Russian. She was called “Zina” which
                was her usual nickname. And in the nineties, when a certain show was on air, it naturally made her <em>Xena, Warrior
                    Princess</em>, something she really used to laugh about.</p>
            <p><img src="./images/Mom-Schoolyard1.jpg"
                    alt="Mom-Schoolyard1" width="217" height="300" data-wp-pid="1023" /><br/>One of Mom's great talents was dramatic
                reading. When she lectured, in a voice filled with feeling and amazing sensitive nuance, the students would pay such
                attention that you could hear a pin drop. Once she mesmerized a hall of rowdy naval base academy officers with her
                literature lecture, and not only because she was young and attractive but because she had a storyteller voice.
                Another time she “woke up” a whole room of jaded party officials out of their usual meeting stupor by her
                presentation of some extremely dry material which she brought to life. Dramatic reading is a powerful part of the
                Russian tradition, and Mom was more than superb. She even acted briefly in her youth, in community theaters. And
                yes, she could sing! We often sang together at home, as I grew up....</p>
            <p>Mom was also a great lover of animals, with the biggest heart you can imagine, and over the years she took in and
                cared for so many strays--dogs, cats, birds, you name it. She even managed to convince other people to rescue and
                care for stray animals even while back in Lebanon and Greece. Two stray dogs had fallen off a cliff in Sounion,
                Greece, where we were staying and fellow Armenian refugee young men climbed down and pulled them out because of Mom
                insisting Dad make them! And in Lebanon she fed a whole family of strays, after a cat gave birth to kittens in the
                old stone house we were staying in—Mom made sure Dad would go to the local butcher shop every day and for a few
                pennies (25 Lebanese piasters) get the daily scraps, and the six cats followed Dad down the street in Beirut and
                waited for him outside the shop perching on trees and signposts, and coming down as soon as he came out. In 1985 we
                became vegetarians together as a family, for ethical reasons.</p>
            <p>Even now that she is gone, our cats wander the rooms sadly in confusion, looking for her. And one cat in particular,
                Sunny, a feral stray black cat we rescued from the woods, gentle and wise, sits on her bed and grieves. Throughout
                her illness, he was literally guarding her, sitting next to her pillow and sleeping near her head, like a loyal
                loving protector.</p>
            <p>These past few days, even as Mom lay in bed declining, going in and out of consciousness, she would constantly ask me
                if I remembered to put out another can of cat food, or changed their water, or added dry food in the dishes. She also
                asked me to make sure to put out birdseed or scraps of grain and bread for the hungry birds in the snow outside.
                That's how much she worried and cared. And she constantly asked me if I myself had eaten, drank tea, rested, when
                she herself could no longer take in food, and could barely drink.<br />
                <img src="./images/Mom-Formal1.jpg" alt="Mom-Formal1"
                    width="191" height="300" data-wp-pid="1024" /><br />Mom stayed sharp, alert, and clear-headed all the way up to
                the end. While she was still sufficiently able to concentrate, I told her the plot of the last two episodes of the
                new season of <em>Downton Abbey</em>, because she really loved that show, but was no longer able to watch TV. We
                speculated on what would happen next and Mom really regretted not ever knowing the ending of the series and the
                future episodes. We speculated whether or not Mary Crawley would eventually get together with Tom Branson, her
                sister Sybil's widower. And when this latest episode aired on Sunday, sadly, Mom was no longer able to hear the
                episode recap, she was too ill and tired....</p>
            <p>Right now the house feels very strange and semi-empty without her. You can feel a tangible void, a presence missing,
                a kind of hollow lightness, an emptiness in her room where before it contained a rich charge of loving energy. The
                balance is shifted and the world has become more flimsy and transparent somehow, less tangible.</p>
            <p>Every few moments I want to say something to her, look in her direction in the room, and she is not there.</p>
            <p>Only her books remain, shelves full, and piles covering every surface, filled with gorgeous volumes of classics,
                philosophy, theology, history, art, and wonder.... From the walls, prints of classical paintings out of the Middle
                Ages look down upon her empty bed, and the bundles of her written journals filled with her living notes and beloved
                handwriting sit in stacks. They are the spirit of Tolstoy and Turgenev, Pushkin and Tchaikovsky, and the whole
                nineteenth century rolled into one, and then going farther back, receding into ancient history of old Rus, amid
                ancient onion dome cathedrals, then simple wooden <em>terem</em> churches, birch trees and rolling open country
                fields underneath a great sky....</p>
            <p>Another part of the true soul of old Russia has left the world. The great bell of the cathedral tolls.</p>
            <p>I am privileged to be her daughter.</p>
            <p>May she rest in serene glory and well earned peace until we all reunite again on the other side, and into the light.

        <div class="row">
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Today is a day like any other day. Only it’s not.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Today the Qualification tests begin—at all designated schools, and public sites in
                    remote places where they don’t have schools, all across the country and around the world—and everyone in my
                    family is trying to pretend things are as usual.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">I am at the messy kitchen counter chewing the breakfast scrambled eggs while the smart
                    wall TV is blaring in the living room. Mom has her back turned and she is leaning over the stove making another
                    skillet, which apparently is burning. I watch Mom’s fragile stooped back, the collar of the flannel pajama top,
                    and the yellow cotton scarf covering her head, bald from the most recent round of chemo. The air is thick with
                    garlic and scalded toast and things unspoken. No one else is up yet.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Need some help burning the house down, Mom?” I say, in-between tasteless bites.
                    Normally I love cheesy garlic eggs, but not today. Today, nothing has a taste. Especially not my forced
                    humor.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Thanks,” she says, without turning around. “But no, I think I am managing just fine
                    with the arson.”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“M-m-m-m,” I say. The skillet makes another grand hiss.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Voices of various morning news show talking heads sound from the living room TV smart
                    wall. “Qualify or die” is repeated often. I imagine there’s a running marquee with that phrase, interspersed
                    with stock tickers and national weather and the continuing coverage of the mystery of a missing plane that
                    disappeared thirty-three years ago, while the footage of the asteroid and then the Atlantis ships hanging in the
                    skies like balloons among the clouds is running on repeat in a small lower window of the screen. Unfortunately
                    that’s the spot of the smart wall surface with the greatest number of bad pixels. Our old wall needs an upgrade,
                    but it’s not going to happen now that the world is about to end.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">They’ve been showing the same footage for the last three months. The asteroid is
                    dramatic, a blazing white monster against black space. It’s hurtling at us head-on. And then it’s always
                    followed by the video clip of the same famous spaceship disk, silvery metallic monolith, miles above the New
                    York skyline. Most of Manhattan ground level is two feet underwater these days, but the skyscrapers remain
                    active centers of business and make for a dramatic backdrop amid the street canals congested with taxi speedboat
                    traffic. There are hundreds of other spaceships of course, all around the country and the world, but they only
                    show the definitive New York one, with the Empire State Building in the frame. The ones here in Vermont, over
                    Burlington, Montpelier, and St. Albans, don’t warrant national coverage.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">George comes into the kitchen. His dark brown hair is sticking up more than usual,
                    which means he’s been tossing and turning all night, and probably had very little sleep, much like me. He looks
                    bleary-eyed too, and his good-looking angular face is stuck in a frown. He’s wearing black jeans and a grey
                    hoodie.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Hey,” I mumble at my seventeen-year-old older brother, and he only gives me the hard
                    thoughtful look. How well I know it, since it’s the same look that I’ve seen in the mirror this morning as I
                    tried to comb the snags out of my own brown hair, long, wavy and unruly, and stared into my hard blue eyes.
                    Grumpy and thoughtful runs in our family. Or at least with some of us. George and I are alike that way, prone to
                    serious, prone to scary quicksilver moods interspersed with sarcasm. And now that Mom’s really sick, we stopped
                    laughing altogether.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Good thing our two younger siblings don’t particularly share this hang-up.
                    Twelve-year-old Grace has always been a giggle machine and chatterbox—though lately she gets weird anxiety
                    attacks at night and has trouble falling asleep, then can’t wake up on time in the morning, and is always late.
                    Dad thinks it’s because she is right on the border of the cutoff age for the Qualification, and it can go either
                    way for her today. So she’s been quietly freaking out.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">As for Gordon, fourteen and sure of himself, he just hums whatever’s playing in his
                    earbuds, and smirks a lot, also quietly, even when he fiddles with his art and woodcrafts stuff. Gordie is
                    convinced he will not Qualify, but he claims he does not care—which is of course crazy, but if it makes it
                    easier for him to deal, then what can be said?</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Have some eggs, George,” Mom says. “Grab a plate.”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“I’m not hungry.” My brother pours himself a glass of cheap apple juice.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Yes, you are. You’ll need it. You can’t run all day on that sugary swill. And it’s
                    going to be a <i>very</i> long day.” Mom turns around and grimaces, looking at the transparent yellowish
                    baby-food liquid that George loves so much. Mom’s skin has an unhealthy grey tint, and at the same time her face
                    is reddened by the heat of the kitchen stove. Both her hands are shaking slightly with the usual tremors. But
                    there is determined focus in her watery blue eyes. I stare at her and see the effort she is making. Margot Lark,
                    my mother, is the strongest person I know.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“You shouldn’t be doing this. You shouldn’t be cooking.” George frowns and gulps down
                    half a glass of juice at once. I watch his Adam’s apple move with each swallow, in tandem with the muscles of
                    his lean neck.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“I am not cooking. You call this cooking?” Mom smiles, throwing me a wink, in an
                    attempt to get me to make my usual sarcastic commentary that indicates I still have a pulse.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“It’s pretty good, actually,” I say, making a show of forking a large piece and chewing
                    and swallowing with enjoyment, even though I am tasting <i>nothing</i> and my insides are filled with rocks.
                    “Where’s everyone else?”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“I heard Gee Three flush the toilet.” George reluctantly takes a plate and Mom dumps
                    half a skillet of cheesy yellow eggs onto it.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">In case it’s unclear, we’re the Four Gees, in order of birth: George, Gwenevere,
                    Gordon, Grace. I still don’t get it why our parents decided to use names starting with the letter “G” for naming
                    all their kids. Mom says she wanted a neat musical pattern to it, and for us to sound “elegant.” Mom is a
                    classical opera singer—or was, before she got sick—so “elegant” is important to her. Dad says it was an old
                    tradition on his mother’s Italian side of the family to use the same initial letter. Honestly, whatever. But
                    everyone in school now calls us the Four Gees, and we’re stuck with it.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Gracie still in bed?” Mom continues, without glancing at George.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“You bet. Want me to go drag her out?”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Mom shakes her head, wipes a dot of skillet splatter off her nose with the back of her
                    hand, still holding a greasy spatula. “No, let her sleep a bit longer. Your father will get her when he comes
                    down. Give them another fifteen minutes. And now I want you to eat.”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">George shrugs. “Whatever. She’ll make everyone late again.”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“No. You’ll be fine.”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">I am still chewing the eggs, swallowing them dutifully like lumps of unknown stuff, and
                    now I feel a familiar pang of fear twist my guts.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;"><i>We’ll be fine</i>. Somehow hearing this makes it worse, brings it all home.</span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;"><i>Today’s the day. </i>The day we’ve been prepping ourselves for, emotionally,
                    psychologically, for weeks and months. And when I say “we,” that’s pretty much everyone on this planet. Teens
                    and their parents. And all the people who care about them. And really, everyone else too, since they get to
                    watch. They get to find out—even though they themselves are out of the picture, out of the running—they get to
                    witness us make it or fail.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Today we Qualify for rescue, for Atlantis.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Or we don’t—which means we’ll die together with all the rest of the world when the
                    asteroid hits Earth, in about eleven months from now. . . .</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">There’s no way to stop it.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">But at least for some of us, there is Atlantis.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Turns out, Atlantis is not a myth. It’s ancient history. There really was a great
                    continent by that name in ancient times, somewhere in the middle of what we now call the Atlantic Ocean,
                    spanning the infamous Bermuda Triangle, the Bahamas, and beyond, and it was home to a very advanced high-tech
                    civilization that stretched around the globe. Supposedly, they had computers, the internet, super-medicine,
                    weapons of mass destruction, probably gaming consoles, and all kinds of other incredible or obnoxious stuff even
                    more sophisticated than our own modern equivalents.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">And then <i>something</i> happened. Maybe they did it to themselves—basically ruined
                    the planet, kind of like what we’re doing now with the environment and other species, the out-of-control
                    pollution, carbon dioxide imbalance and resulting cascade of climate change. Or maybe it was Mother Nature, at
                    least in part.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Because at some point more than twelve thousand years ago, something huge and terrible
                    took place—a mega-cataclysm on such a scale that it caused a whole continent to disappear without a trace, in
                    earthquakes and floods and who knows what—and wiped the high-level civilization off the face of the planet. To
                    escape this global disaster—we are told—the people of Atlantis used their advanced technology to leave Earth and
                    flee to the stars. They eventually established a human colony on a habitable planet.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">They called this colony planet “Atlantis,” or whatever’s the equivalent in their
                    language, in memory of their own ancient roots on Earth, to honor their native civilization and the terrestrial
                    continent of their birth that started it all.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">And now, after all these thousands of years, they’re back. They returned to Earth,
                    their ancient home world, and they are here to help. That is, the distant descendants of the original Atlantean
                    colonists are here to help. They claim to be one hundred percent human and supposedly <i>not all that different
                        from ourselves</i>—if you don’t count the thousands of generations of separate evolution and branching off
                    to live in an alien environment. Yeah, right.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Anyway, the Atlanteans share our DNA and they’re our cousins. And, just like cousins,
                    it makes them either weird or welcome guests.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Right now, they are desperately welcome and desperately needed. The asteroid brought
                    them here—or, like some paranoid people in the media say, maybe “they brought the asteroid.”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Whichever it is, at this point, Atlantis is all we’ve got.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">When the news of the lethal asteroid first broke, months ago, almost simultaneously the
                    Atlantean spaceships appeared in the skies all over the world. It’s as if they’ve been watching us, and waiting
                    to make first contact. The asteroid just gave them the excuse.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Okay, at first it was a huge global mess. World governments going into panic mode and
                    military overdrive, people on the streets screaming about alien invasions, religious fundamentalists having a
                    field day, scientists having aneurisms, stock markets crashing worldwide, to the tune of billions.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">But once the Atlantean shuttles landed, and we saw them to be human and not little
                    green men or big green lizards, it was okay. They met with representatives of governments, the United Nations,
                    and were received with caution and eventually with open arms. “We are you,” they told us in various languages of
                    Earth. How they knew our languages is unclear, but it’s probably some kind of advanced tech, or they’ve been
                    listening in on us for far longer than we know. They explained who they were—which is kind of insane if you
                    think about it, all that mythic stuff that Plato wrote about is mostly true—and demonstrated some of their
                    amazing technology.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Only it wasn’t all that amazing when it came to the asteroid.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Yes, they tried moving it and changing the path of its trajectory, and all kinds of
                    other advanced science stuff, in conjunction with global space agencies and the three International space
                    stations we currently have—the largest one in Earth orbit, a second small one on the surface of the moon and the
                    barely functional newest one on Mars. They even landed on the asteroid’s surface and drilled and took samples.
                    But nothing worked, at least not enough to make a difference. The asteroid is going to hit Earth and it is going
                    to cause nuclear winter at best. And at worst—well, let’s just say there may not be much of this planet left
                    after the impact. . . .</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">However, not all is lost. Because the Atlanteans are going to save as many of us as
                    possible and take us back with them—back to the colony planet Atlantis, a fertile blue-green world that’s
                    supposed to be beautiful beyond belief, with a golden-white sun and not one but three moons.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">To that effect, they have brought enough spaceships to carry millions of people. It
                    sounds great but means they can only rescue a very small portion of the general Earth population of eight point
                    five billion—no more than can fill their present fleet of monolith silver ships, since there is no time for
                    multiple trips between Earth and Atlantis before the asteroid strikes.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">There is only one condition for rescue. Those lucky few that get to board the Atlantis
                    ships have to be young people between the ages of twelve and twenty—teenagers.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Capable, talented, special teenagers.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">The best of the best on Earth.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">And the only way to determine who these teens will be is to make them pass
                    Qualification. . . .</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;"><i>Qualify or die. </i></span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">The smart wall in the living room is playing TV snippets of a canned interview with the
                    President. Later tonight she will address the nation live. . . . But for now it’s old footage. President
                    Katherine Donahue is speaking in her usual droning and soothing voice that’s powerful and at the same time
                    conciliatory, in that nasty mixture that only politicians manage. “Our children and we must be brave together,
                    but rest assured, no one’s giving up” and “we hold them in our prayers as Qualification looms” and “the ultimate
                    survival and benefit of humanity might ultimately depend on well-orchestrated air strikes” are some of the
                    phrases heard.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Same old junk they’ve been saying for months, as soon as they figured out that nothing
                    substantial could be done to stop the asteroid, and that the Atlanteans are not all-powerful after all, despite
                    what everyone hoped.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Thing is, the governments, the global leaders, the media, the scientists, the talking
                    heads—they all feel the guilt-ridden need to keep talking, keep trying, even up to the last, even as the world
                    goes up in flames or ash clouds or whatever. “Vaporware Hope,” as Dad calls it, is one way to fill up the void
                    between <i>now</i> and <i>the end</i>.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Sure, there’s Qualification. But for the human spirit that’s just not good enough.  To
                    that end, there are also numerous space missions being prepped by the United Nations and private conglomerates,
                    by individual governments and science agencies. Everyone’s building shuttles, rockets and “payload delivery
                    systems,” whatever that means, to see if they can blast the asteroid into manageable bits or move it out of the
                    fatal earth-contact trajectory. Meanwhile, others are building spaceship arks, just to get off the planet—kind
                    of like the ancient Atlanteans themselves did, thousands of years ago. I guess they think, maybe if they can
                    just get far enough away from the blast and resulting atmospheric turbulence, the Atlanteans might guide them
                    the rest of the way?</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">The Atlanteans observe these various efforts sadly, and have indeed volunteered to
                    assist to the best of their abilities. But the reality remains grim, there’s not all that much that can be done,
                    at least not for the majority of living beings on Earth. The asteroid is huge and supposedly made up of mostly
                    heavy metals and some other newly discovered stuff that makes it pretty much impossible to move or damage—or so
                    they say. And as for escape, there are simply too many people, animal species, and too few ships.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">President Donahue’s words are cut off briefly with video-bytes of breaking news,
                    basically public unrest worldwide, demonstrations around school buses that are supposed to take us all to the
                    Qualification sites, various local police forces in riot gear, and people screaming and throwing rocks and
                    demanding justice. “Please! Just save my baby!” a woman somewhere in the Midwest is crying in a crazed voice of
                    despair. “What good are my tax dollars with all your idiot scientists and useless military and failed national
                    defense? Why can’t you nuke that space rock and save us!”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">The stairs creak softly under Dad’s familiar steady footsteps. He comes down, fully
                    dressed in his nice beige blazer, black shirt, brown slacks, tweed vest. And he’s wearing a tie, which is a rare
                    thing. My father, Charles Lark, is the epitome of academia, with his rimless spectacles, somewhat tousled, wavy
                    brown hair and greying temples. He is a professor of classics and history at the local University, and is
                    exactly what you might think that means. Smart, and a little eccentric, and living mostly inside his head, his
                    lesson plans, and research, with plenty of oddball stories and trivia to tell to his kids.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Let’s please turn the awful TV off,” Dad says tiredly. He is bleary-eyed too, and he
                    is immediately looking at Mom.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Good morning!” Mom throws him a cheerful look and turns her back again. “I thought all
                    of you might want some real breakfast today. Coffee’s ready.”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“How are you feeling? You really shouldn’t be up so early, straining yourself.” Dad
                    goes directly for the coffee maker.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Are you kidding? This is good for me. Besides, I would never miss seeing all of you
                    off today, of all days.”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Why, what’s today?” George says grimly.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">From the living room now comes the familiar voice of the Atlantean fleet commander
                    giving his now famous inspirational speech to the United Nations. The voice is soft, rich and musical. It is
                    pleasant in timbre despite the strange lilting accent, and the Atlantean is speaking perfect English. Which is
                    all kind of amazing. And yet it makes my skin crawl with new pangs of fear. Because there’s all that strange,
                    leashed power in that voice, and it’s held back somehow. How do I know this? I don’t, I have no idea. But
                    Commander Manakteon Resoi (try saying that three times) with his pleasant, sonorous voice, his fixed handsome
                    face, metallic-golden blond hair and contrasting black eyebrows that seems to be typical of his ethnicity, gives
                    me the creeps. Especially when he talks about “humanitarian efforts amid failure of hope” and “technological
                    impetus” and “a new era for Earth and Atlantis.”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“I hate that Goldilocks guy and his BS,” George mumbles.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;"><i>Goldilocks</i>. That’s the derogatory term being used lately to refer to Atlanteans,
                    because supposedly they all color their hair metallic gold, which is a fashion statement. Or maybe it’s an
                    indicator of rank. No one’s sure. Apparently, gold’s so common and abundant on Atlantis, that it’s considered a
                    base metal. . . .</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">In that moment, the stairs groan as Gracie and Gordie come downstairs one after the
                    other, Gracie trailing. My younger brother Gordon is slight and skinny, lacking the sinewy strength and height
                    of George, and with brown hair that’s several shades lighter and so short it’s almost buzzed. He’s wearing his
                    usual dingy jeans and faded black sweatshirt with paint stains on it. And his rimless glasses have dirty finger
                    spots you can see from several feet away.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Gracie is last. She is a younger version of me, tall and slim, except without any
                    curves and with straight long hair that’s dirty blond instead of dark like mine. Gracie is dressed up in pastel
                    pink skinny jeans and a black sweater with sequins. She is wearing black eyeliner, mascara and lip gloss and
                    gaudy plastic bangles on her wrists. Normally Mom would say something about the eye junk and the lip gloss, but
                    today Grace Lark gets to wear whatever she likes—whatever gives her strength.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“All right,” Mom says. “Everyone get plates, these cheesy eggs are pure magic!”</span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Thanks, Mom. Pile it on.” Gordie heads right for the kitchen counter and pulls up a
                    chair, while Gracie stops in the middle of the kitchen and stares. Her face is very pale, and she looks sickly,
                    despite her mascara and lip gloss.  Or maybe because of it.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Gracie, honey, don’t waste time, please.” Mom picks up a clean plate and starts
                    filling it.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“I don’t want any eggs.”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Dad sits down nearby at the small side table with his mug of coffee and a plate of
                    eggs. “Your Mom got up early and made the breakfast, and you should eat it.”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Grace is frowning. “I hate eggs, and I’m not really hungry.”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Okay,” Mom sighs. “How about a banana and toast? You need to eat something today. You
                    know you do.”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“We’re out of bananas,” I recall. “Gracie, come on, why don’t you just eat the eggs,
                    just this once, okay?  They’re really good! Yummy-yum-yum! Protein and fuel!”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Gracie shrugs. I can’t believe she is this quiet. She’s not even calling me an
                    idiot.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“We have ten minutes,” George says. “Move it, Gee Four.”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Gracie silently slips onto a chair at the counter and reaches for a slice of
                    toast.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"> * * *<br /></span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">A few minutes later we’re in the old minivan, headed for school, with Dad at the wheel.
                    We still feel Mom’s tight desperate hugs and ringing-hard kisses on our cheeks. In my mind, she’s still standing
                    at the porch, waving, and her eyes are red and swimming in tears as she watches us drive away. If we Qualify,
                    this will be the last time we ever see Mom. Already I am fixing this image of her, searing it into
                    memory.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Usually George drives us in his peeling truck, but today Dad is bringing us in, as if
                    to make sure we are delivered properly in time for the Qualification tests. All our duffel bags are packed in
                    the trunk, in addition to the usual school backpacks. Everything’s according to the official Qualification
                    instructions that have been handed out weeks in advance by the schools that are designated RQS, or Regional
                    Qualification Sites. Our bags contain a basic travel kit, a change of clothing, and a few personal items which
                    are up to us. The assumption is, if we advance in the Qualification preliminary stage, we will be taken directly
                    to the National Centers where the rest of the process will take place. And we don’t get to say goodbye to
                    anyone.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">My duffel bag has a few of my favorite books including <i>The Iliad</i>, <i>The
                        Odyssey</i>, <i>The 101 Dalmatians</i>, and <i>The Birthgrave</i>. Okay, it has a lot of books, and is
                    heaviest, and almost exceeds the forty pounds limit. That’s because these are actual honest-to-goodness books,
                    printed on paper. Yeah, you heard that right. Some of them are rare collector editions from Dad’s library. Dad
                    often says that an electromagnetic pulse or EMP disaster can strike any moment and destroy our digital
                    information storage capability, so he’s been hoarding the paper print editions like precious treasure for most
                    of his life. His personal library is amazing. And now here’s my chance to save some of those classics before the
                    asteroid takes them first.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to the load of books, my bag also has a small pouch of trinkets. There are
                    family photos, a tiny rose crystal Pegasus figurine, and a sterling silver dancing fairy locket my parents gave
                    me for my sixteenth birthday a few months ago. It’s not electronic-enhanced smart jewelry, but it has
                    heart.<br /></span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">George has chosen to pack close to nothing of personal value, only an extra pair of
                    running shoes and some flat rectangular thing wrapped in brown paper, plus a bunch of paper books for Dad’s
                    sake. In contrast, Gordie’s duffel has micro-bead CDs, rare sheet music, and his skinny Backpacker travel
                    guitar, in addition to his favorite weird quartz pieces from his extensive rock collection, a purple geode, a
                    Swiss Army knife, a portable color pen-and-pencil art box, and a sketchbook. As for Gracie, she has taken her
                    costume jewelry including a pair of latest version smart earrings, a cosmetics pouch, and her flute. And yeah,
                    more of Dad’s books.<br /></span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">I stare outside the window at the bleary landscape. It’s March, but snow is still on
                    the ground, and the sky is overcast.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">However, as I stare southeast, the Atlantean ship in the sky over St. Albans can be
                    seen in the corner of the window, through the tall pine and maple trees. From this distance it looks like a
                    flattened weather balloon, silvery metal. In reality, I know it is massive, almost a mile in diameter. It
                    hovers, motionless, silent, eternal.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Gordie, Gracie, George, my Dad, all of us glance at it periodically.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">George is up in the front passenger seat next to Dad, and he voice commands the car
                    radio on. Immediately there is a blast of riot noise, and the radio deejay comes on with frenzied commentary.
                    The mayors of Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and Inland Los Angeles are being interviewed about the ramifications
                    of crowd control and widespread urban looting, and next up, expert practical advice from a pop psychologist at
                    something dot com: “Five Tips for Teens—how to maximize your chances to Qualify today.”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Oh great, do we have to listen to this?” Dad says.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">George invokes the scan function on the radio and it jumps to a music station.</span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“No, don’t turn it off!” Gracie clutches the back of George’s seat. “I want to hear the
                    five tips!”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“No, you don’t.”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Yes I <i>do!</i>”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">George groans.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Gordie just stares out the window with blissful indifference and his earbuds are
                    crackling with his own entertainment.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“All right.” Dad is turning off the main highway onto a smaller road that’s near our
                    high school and Gracie’s middle school, both in the same complex. Our schools are a designated Regional
                    Qualification Site. The traffic is busier than usual, as parents from other school districts are dropping off
                    their children, and everyone wants to be on time. Car horns are blaring. We make the turn into school grounds
                    and the rows of yellow buses are already lined up in the parking lot, ready to take those of us who are lucky
                    enough to pass the preliminaries on to the next stage of Qualification, hours later.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“You want five tips?” Dad says seriously. “I’ll give you five tips. Number one—”</span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“I don’t want <i>your</i> tips! I want what that program was going to say!” Gracie’s
                    voice rises in that same whiny awful noise that has been produced by her for weeks now, whenever something
                    doesn’t go her way.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Oh, jeez—” George shakes his head.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“I want to hear Dad,” I say.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Gracie turns around and glares at me. Her hand is still clutching the back of the seat
                    in front of her with a white-knuckled grip.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Speak fast, Dad, because we’re almost here.”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">I see my father’s sad, drawn expression reflected in the rear view mirror. He looks old
                    suddenly, old and exhausted. He takes a silent breath and pushes his spectacles up his nose. “Tip number one—be
                    yourself. Number two—do the best you can under the circumstances and never let fear control you and make you
                    freeze. Number three—okay—” He pauses and I see him make the tired effort to say something constructive and
                    hopeful. “Number three—listen to your gut instinct, always.  Your gut is one smart buddy there. Listen to it.
                    Number four—never give up. Never, ever, ever, times infinity. Number five—make the choice that will ultimately
                    make you feel good inside about yourself—as a human being. That’s always the right choice.”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Are you done?” Gracie says.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Dad sighs. “You know how hard it is for all of us, Grace. Take a big breath. All right,
                    we’re almost there.”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Thanks for the words of wisdom, Dad. That’s actually gold in them thar hills. I bet
                    you wrote it up last night in your lecture notes. Am I right?” George mumbles while looking straight ahead, as
                    he begins to get ready to unbuckle his seatbelt even before we are parked.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Yeah, well,” Dad says. “What if I did? Couldn’t let you all go without saying
                    something brilliant to help you remember your old man by. There’s actually more, but I thought the ‘five tips’
                    gave me a nice excuse to summarize. Want to hear the rest? No? I didn’t think so. It was worth a try.”</span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">The minivan is still crawling along in a line of cars through the parking lot and onto
                    the football field that has been designated as supplementary parking. Security guards stand, waving the cars
                    into parking spots or designated dropoff points. There are also several media news vans and vehicles with video
                    and sound equipment. Even now, they are filming us live. It’s weird to think, but all that’s happening right now
                    is being recorded, is breaking news. . . .</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">We stop not too far from the side entrance to the main school building, in the yellow
                    zone. Kids and parents are everywhere, opening cars, carrying bags. Many people are crying.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">We get out, and Dad pops the trunk, which sails open slowly.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Shivering in my jacket from the chill morning air, I stand waiting for George to get
                    his duffel bag, while Gordie has his already. Grace stands right behind me, breathing down my neck.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Dad stops the engine and comes around to help us. Or more likely he is gathering
                    himself for the big goodbye.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">I glance around, seeing students I know, other classmates, heading up the stairs and
                    inside, past security. Carrie Willis, a girl from my class rushes by with tear-reddened eyes, dragging a bulky,
                    ugly purple-and-orange travel bag that’s rolling along on squeaky wheels. Her mom and some other relatives watch
                    below, waving and sobbing.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Gordie watches her also, shakes his head and adjusts the strap of his heavy duffel bag,
                    then pulls his knitted ski hat over his reddened ears. “This is all seriously messed up.”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Yeah, that one there seriously needs new luggage.” George steps back, shouldering his
                    bag and his backpack with muscular ease.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“No, I mean, <i>this</i>, all of this situation—she, they, us, everyone, the world,”
                    Gordie says.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">I lean forward and take my turn with my stuff. It feels surreal, like someone else is
                    going through the motions. My backpack is hoisted up and lands on my back with a thud that’s lessened by the
                    stuffed lining of my winter jacket. I adjust the straps on both arms, then reach for the heavier duffel.</span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Gracie is starting to sniffle behind me, and I hear Dad embrace her in a bear
                    hug.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;"><i>Well, this is it.</i></span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">I suddenly feel a burning in my eyes. In the back of my throat a huge horrible lump is
                    gathering. No, I am not going to cry.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">But the pressure is building in my sinuses, and as I keep my eyes open wide, afraid to
                    blink, already I can feel the first stupid fat teardrop starting to well in one eye, as my vision gets blurry. I
                    back away from the minivan, while Gracie disengages from Dad’s hug, wipes her face with the back of her
                    hand—which smears her eyeliner on one side—and goes for her bag with trembling hands.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">I stand watching the peeling spots of paint on the wall of the school building, while
                    blurs of students are going past me up the stairs. I am momentarily distracted from needing to bawl by the
                    familiar faces. Mindy Erikson walks by with her stuff, and her flaming red hair. . . . There goes football jock
                    Nick Warren and his younger brother, whatshisname.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Gwen, honey . . .” Dad’s voice cuts through everything and it makes me turn around and
                    look at him, and face him at last.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Here, my sweet girl, there you go,” Dad says, reaching out for me, and I meet his
                    eyes, and it breaks me completely. <i>Dad. . . .  This is my dad, and he is going to die.</i></span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">I am glad that next comes the great big hug so he doesn’t see me start to lose it.
                    Instead I lose myself in his chest, and crush my face against the beige blazer, and think about how he’ll have
                    to have it dry cleaned to get my stupid tears and snot off the fabric. I stay that way for several moments,
                    shaking silently, feeling Dad’s powerful embrace and smelling the faint aftershave and wool scent of his
                    clothes.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“My brave, smart Gwen,” Dad says in my ear. “Love you, honey, stay strong! Promise me,
                    never give up! Watch out for your sister and brothers—”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Love you, Dad, I will. . . .”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">I let go, and stand back, and smear my face with the back of my hand, and that’s
                    it.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">I watch Dad take Gordie in a quick tight hug, and pat his back, and then George, who
                    evades the hug and instead gets a grownup handshake.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Well, this is it,” Dad says. He takes a symbolic step back and nods at us, and says,
                    “God speed, go on, all of you! I promise you, the Lark family will Qualify, hands down, all four of you!” I see
                    Dad’s eyes are sort of red too, as he just stands there, looking at us through his spectacles.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">George nods briefly, and just for a moment he is suspended, motionless, like a post. He
                    turns and gives the rest of us a serious look. “Okay! Let’s do this. See you on the flip side.” And George heads
                    up the stairs.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Gordie follows, trudging silently.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Gracie and I take a moment longer, to give Dad another last look.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">“Go on!” he says. “Don’t be late now, hurry! Your Mom and I are rooting for you one
                    hundred percent. Go!”</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">And so I take my sister by the arm, and pull her along, and we start up the
                    steps.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">We enter the school building without looking around again at Dad.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">It’s easier this way.</span></p>
