                Zinaida Petrovna Nazarian<br/>
                My beloved mother, kind, generous, warmhearted, long-suffering, enduring, brave, the gentlest, light-filled soul you
                may ever know, died at the age of 82, under hospice care at home in Vermont at 10:22 PM at night on Tuesday (2/3/15)
                after two difficult months of what we thought was a severe, relentless flu and turned out to be leukemia. She
                already survived ovarian cancer in 2007--a year filled with multiple surgeries, complications, infections,
                chemotherapy, hernias, hospital stays--and this time decided that she did not want to go through that again. With
                her passing, the generation of my fathers is now gone.</p>
            <p>Mom was a true survivor. She survived the early days of the Soviet Union, the Nazi occupation of Crimea during World
                War II, not once but twice, as she, a little girl, and my grandmother fled the Germans twice as refugees, all across
                Central Asia and back, riding in freight trains, living homeless underneath an open sky and huddling under blankets
                while getting strafed from overhead by German sniper planes, being rescued and ferried by a battleship in the Black
                Sea, starving among death and dysentery, and finally returning home to Crimea when the war was over, and seeing her
                parents divorce as soon as her father, my grandfather Pyotr Ilyich Ushanov (a captain of a tank division in the Red
                Army) returned from the war a changed man.</p>
            <p>Mom was true old-fashioned Russian, through and through. She grew up in Simferopol, Crimea, living with her
                now-divorced mother, my grandmother Antonina Ivanovna Dementieva (who was the equivalent of the town mayor of
                Simferopol, a high ranking position) and became a teacher of Russian Language and Literature. She taught the
                equivalent of older high school and adult lectures, in Simferopol and other local regions of Crimea including
                military officers schools, in a tiny village school in Siberia, and eventually in Moscow.</p>
            <p>Mom was cultured, refined and always in pursuit of knowledge and learning, an expert in classics of world literature
                and history. She did her final graduation thesis on Jack London, and I remember when I visited Oakland, CA for the
                first time, Mom told me with reverence to look out for things related to him. All my love of language and reading I
                owe to Mom, who imbued my soul with myth, imagery, and literature.</p>
            <p>When she lived in Moscow, studying to apply to the equivalent of graduate school, she met my Dad, Georgii (George)
                Nazarian, an Armenian from Tbilisi, Georgia, in the Moscow Library, of all places. They married and she stayed in
                Moscow permanently, until the mid seventies when we immigrated to the West, leaving the USSR as refugees to Lebanon.
            </p>
            <p>This was when Mom got to survive her second war, the civil war in Lebanon, and be a refugee yet again as we fled with
                other Armenian families to Greece, and finally the United States, where after a long and arduous process she became
                a Permanent Resident and then a US Citizen (among other things, she had to get fingerprinted more than eight times
                by the INS, because her fingerprints were nearly non-existent, the normal whorl patterns worn off the tips of her
                fingers from a lifetime of doing hot water laundry by hand, as all other Russian women of the time.)</p>
            <p>Mom was always reading one book or another, mostly classics in Russian (or Russian translation) and in English. When
                I was a little girl, she originally thought and hoped I would be a literature teacher too, but I turned out a writer
                instead, with many thanks to her, thus staying true to the general notion, and working within the field of literary
                pursuits. She even named me “Vera” (which means “Faith” in Russian), for her favorite female literary character
                Vera, from Ivan Goncharov's <em>The Precipice</em>. (Even now I want to ask Mom a specific detail about this book,
                and turn, and realize she is not there; I can no longer do that, I can never ask her about anything ever again...)
            </p>

                    width="228" height="300" data-wp-pid="1021" /><br />Although she claimed she was not a writer herself, at one point
                many years later, when we were living in Winnetka, California, Mom tried creative writing, and wrote, among other
                things, in Russian, a novella-length variation of Jane Austen's <em>Persuasion</em>, her favorite Austen novel! She
                chose to write about Captain Wentworth traveling on a ship, heartbroken and thinking of his lost love. In Mom's
                story, Wentworth looks out into the ocean and encounters a mermaid, whose lovely dialogue with him convinces him to
                return to seek Anne Elliot's love once more—a beautiful, heart-wrenching, haunting, and well written fantasy novella
                that I just might publish under Mom's own name in Russian, one of these days!</p>
            <p>In addition to literature, Mom loved classical music, especially symphonies and orchestral music, and classical
                Russian Ballet. Back in Russia, she grew up listening to symphonies on the early radio programs. And later here in
                the US, we would always watch ballets and performances on PBS. Art and architecture was also a great love, and Mom
                enjoyed museums and art galleries whenever possible.</p>
            <p><img src="./images/Mom-Hat1-1024x709.jpg" alt="Mom-Hat1"
                    width="300" height="207" data-wp-pid="1022" /><br/>She'd dreamed of traveling the world, and got her wish in part,
                when we became immigrants. At one amazing point, when we were refugees being bused in Greece from the Sounion coast
                to the Athens medical center where they ran the required exams on us before allowing entrance to the US, we drove
                right past the Acropolis. Mom and I started to scream in awe and excitement, pointing and saying, “That's the
                Parthenon!” until other refugees on the bus were asking, “What, what?” and looking at us like we were crazy. We
                never had a chance to get closer to the great temple, but that moment will stay with me always. We were this close
                to it, but were not allowed to leave the bus. Classical Ancient Greece, our impossible dream, so near yet just out
                of reach....</p>
            <p>It's interesting to note that Mom's name, “Zinaida” means “Daughter of Zeus” in Russian. She was called “Zina” which
                was her usual nickname. And in the nineties, when a certain show was on air, it naturally made her <em>Xena, Warrior
                    Princess</em>, something she really used to laugh about.</p>
            <p><img src="./images/Mom-Schoolyard1.jpg"
                    alt="Mom-Schoolyard1" width="217" height="300" data-wp-pid="1023" /><br/>One of Mom's great talents was dramatic
                reading. When she lectured, in a voice filled with feeling and amazing sensitive nuance, the students would pay such
                attention that you could hear a pin drop. Once she mesmerized a hall of rowdy naval base academy officers with her
                literature lecture, and not only because she was young and attractive but because she had a storyteller voice.
                Another time she “woke up” a whole room of jaded party officials out of their usual meeting stupor by her
                presentation of some extremely dry material which she brought to life. Dramatic reading is a powerful part of the
                Russian tradition, and Mom was more than superb. She even acted briefly in her youth, in community theaters. And
                yes, she could sing! We often sang together at home, as I grew up....</p>
            <p>Mom was also a great lover of animals, with the biggest heart you can imagine, and over the years she took in and
                cared for so many strays--dogs, cats, birds, you name it. She even managed to convince other people to rescue and
                care for stray animals even while back in Lebanon and Greece. Two stray dogs had fallen off a cliff in Sounion,
                Greece, where we were staying and fellow Armenian refugee young men climbed down and pulled them out because of Mom
                insisting Dad make them! And in Lebanon she fed a whole family of strays, after a cat gave birth to kittens in the
                old stone house we were staying in—Mom made sure Dad would go to the local butcher shop every day and for a few
                pennies (25 Lebanese piasters) get the daily scraps, and the six cats followed Dad down the street in Beirut and
                waited for him outside the shop perching on trees and signposts, and coming down as soon as he came out. In 1985 we
                became vegetarians together as a family, for ethical reasons.</p>
            <p>Even now that she is gone, our cats wander the rooms sadly in confusion, looking for her. And one cat in particular,
                Sunny, a feral stray black cat we rescued from the woods, gentle and wise, sits on her bed and grieves. Throughout
                her illness, he was literally guarding her, sitting next to her pillow and sleeping near her head, like a loyal
                loving protector.</p>
            <p>These past few days, even as Mom lay in bed declining, going in and out of consciousness, she would constantly ask me
                if I remembered to put out another can of cat food, or changed their water, or added dry food in the dishes. She also
                asked me to make sure to put out birdseed or scraps of grain and bread for the hungry birds in the snow outside.
                That's how much she worried and cared. And she constantly asked me if I myself had eaten, drank tea, rested, when
                she herself could no longer take in food, and could barely drink.<br />
                <img src="./images/Mom-Formal1.jpg" alt="Mom-Formal1"
                    width="191" height="300" data-wp-pid="1024" /><br />Mom stayed sharp, alert, and clear-headed all the way up to
                the end. While she was still sufficiently able to concentrate, I told her the plot of the last two episodes of the
                new season of <em>Downton Abbey</em>, because she really loved that show, but was no longer able to watch TV. We
                speculated on what would happen next and Mom really regretted not ever knowing the ending of the series and the
                future episodes. We speculated whether or not Mary Crawley would eventually get together with Tom Branson, her
                sister Sybil's widower. And when this latest episode aired on Sunday, sadly, Mom was no longer able to hear the
                episode recap, she was too ill and tired....</p>
            <p>Right now the house feels very strange and semi-empty without her. You can feel a tangible void, a presence missing,
                a kind of hollow lightness, an emptiness in her room where before it contained a rich charge of loving energy. The
                balance is shifted and the world has become more flimsy and transparent somehow, less tangible.</p>
            <p>Every few moments I want to say something to her, look in her direction in the room, and she is not there.</p>
            <p>Only her books remain, shelves full, and piles covering every surface, filled with gorgeous volumes of classics,
                philosophy, theology, history, art, and wonder.... From the walls, prints of classical paintings out of the Middle
                Ages look down upon her empty bed, and the bundles of her written journals filled with her living notes and beloved
                handwriting sit in stacks. They are the spirit of Tolstoy and Turgenev, Pushkin and Tchaikovsky, and the whole
                nineteenth century rolled into one, and then going farther back, receding into ancient history of old Rus, amid
                ancient onion dome cathedrals, then simple wooden <em>terem</em> churches, birch trees and rolling open country
                fields underneath a great sky....</p>
            <p>Another part of the true soul of old Russia has left the world. The great bell of the cathedral tolls.</p>
            <p>I am privileged to be her daughter.</p>
            <p>May she rest in serene glory and well earned peace until we all reunite again on the other side, and into the light.

            <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Why a Book Bomb?</span></strong></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Because if everyone buys on the same day, especially <a title="Amazon"
                        href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DK02MHG/?tag=veranazariafantaA"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>from
                                Amazon</strong></span></a>, then the book rises in the rank <strong>(gets a lower number, aiming for
                        #1)</strong>, and becomes</span> <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">more visible to other
                        buyers</span></strong> <span style="color: #000000;">worldwide in the Amazon store</span>.</p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">And this sets up a</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">self-sustaining chain reaction
                    of visibility</span>, <span style="color: #000000;">so that the more people see it, the more people might
                    potentially buy it, and keep it visible for others in a self-perpetuating cycle!</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Books in the</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Top 100</span> <span
                    style="color: #000000;">are displayed on the</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">first few pages</span> <span
                    style="color: #000000;">of the various</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">bestsellers lists</span>. <span
                    style="color: #000000;">As a general rule, more people tend to look at the first page when they browse for
                    books, and few keep looking beyond the first three. Almost no one bothers to keep clicking pages, so the further
                    down the lists a book is, the less chances it has.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">A book bomb is a concerted effort to propel the book up the ranks toward the top
                    spots.</span>  <span style="color: #0000ff;">Staying there</span> <span style="color: #000000;">of course
                    is</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">up to the book itself</span>, <span style="color: #000000;">but
                    that</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">initial push</span> <span style="color: #000000;">is something that
                    you can all do to help!</span></p>

            <p><span style="color: #800000;">This is an expanded article version of a series of posts, starting with <a
                        title="Secret to marketing on kboards.com"
                        href="http://www.kboards.com/index.php/topic,149634.100.html"><span style="color: #800000;">my post on
                            Kboards.com</span></a> in response to whether there is an actual honest-to-goodness <strong>secret to
                        publishing success</strong> that is clandestinely employed by successful self-published "Indies."</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #800000;">A writer mentioned half-humorously that their answer to a friend who has long suspected
                    that there is "a secret method to achieving high sales" is simply "no."</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #800000;">I responded with the following:</span></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Thing is, there <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>is</b></span> a secret.</p>
            <p>And it is something that so many of us glean over, and just sort of overlook willingly, because we tell ourselves it
                just couldn't be that prosaic, could it? No, no way.</p>
            <p>We repeat the healthy mantra "write more books, and write the best books you can."</p>
            <p>However, even having done so, even though it is mostly true, we still feel the strange "sixth" sense of having missed
                something else in the equation.</p>
            <p>And here it is, the secret thing we're choosing to overlook and miss, over and over.</p>
            <p>It is <i><b>money</b></i>.</p>
            <p>The dirty little secret above and beyond persistence and talent is money -- in other words, the means to utilize
                every and all possible beneficial resources at our disposal.  I am talking not just about paid advertizing, but
                everything else that money can buy -- time (yours and other professionals who can help you), assistance of others
                (minions, a street team, posse, whatever) you can pay to do publishing tasks for you (high end cover design,
                editing, website, creative legwork), the ability to pay hefty entrance fees to various exclusive contests and
                opportunities for exposure such as high profile ARC venues and mass mailings, the usage of PR Newswire, NetGalley,
                special PR Firms, Book Tours, etc.</p>
            <p>All of the above and more, <b>cumulatively</b>.</p>
            <p>If you cannot afford even a single <a title="Bookbub" href="http://www.bookbub.com/advertise/">Bookbub</a> ad, or a
                paid book blast mailing, frankly your options to get exposure are limited.</p>
            <p>And if you say you've been using some (or even many) of the above techniques regularly, and paying for numerous ads
                and services, and you are still in a mid-list rut and have not achieved the proverbial break-out, I say to you --
                how much <b>worse off</b> would you be now if you had not in fact done any of those <b>paid things</b>?</p>
            <p>So yes, that's the secret, folks.</p>
            <p>Money (and the liberal, cleverly planned usage of it) allows you to buy a bouquet of multiple opportunities,
                including that one thing that in your case could be that bit of luck that will catapult you into the stratosphere.
            </p>
            <p>But you already know it.<br/>
            Time to face the reality.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline;">and an
                            addendum post:</span></strong></span>
            <br/>
            It is sneaky, because time = money.  Yours, somebody's, etc. We can call it something else, but it is what it is.</p>
            <p>Luck also takes money.  I like to say that "before a lottery ticket is a winner, someone has to buy it" -- in other
                words, literally it's not luck, it's <b>luck plus a buck</b> (or more, if you bought a bunch) that gets you that
                winning ticket.</p>
            <p>As someone who also does pretty much everything myself (book writing, cover design, formatting, promotion, website
                work), it all adds up to my health and life energy, and giving it my all.</p>
            <p>And I am flat broke, with holes on clothing and a chronically empty fridge too. This year I am at the lowest point
                ever (recovering from foreclosure and bankruptcy and major illness etc, etc) but I've been actually for once paying
                for some things, but it's all blood money, food money, literally.</p>
            <p>So it's all money underneath.<br/>
            * * *</p>
            <p><span style="color: #800000;">The following day, I decided to sit down and brainstorm all the various methods, tips
                    and tricks that I've gleaned over the last year and a half of closely following the <a title="Writers Cafe"
                        href="http://www.kboards.com/index.php/board,60.0.html"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Writers'
                                Cafe</strong> forum at <strong>Kboards.com</strong></span></a>, but with the caveat that the
                    <strong>methods are all free</strong> and hence entirely affordable for not only those with the means to
                    purchase advertising and other professional promo services, but for the poor-as-Church-Mice authors.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #800000;">Here are the things I came up with, as a <strong>promotional core</strong>, summarized
                    in another post:</span></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>It's a fact.</p>
            <p>Many of us <b>cannot afford even basic advertising</b> -- promoted Facebook posts ($7 a pop), various sites' book
                blasts and listings ($10-$25 a pop), much less the high end stuff like BookBub, ENT, KND, NetGalley, PR Newswire, PR
                Firms, etc....</p>
            <p>All this stuff that feeds and powers (behind-the-scenes) the engine to <b>kick-launch</b> our books into regular and
                established visibility and <b>maintain</b> it there. (Ultimately, it's the same engine that major publishers use to
                launch their mega-sellers, and that many -- but <b>not all</b>, of course -- successful indies use to put themselves
                in a position to regularly move thousands of units.)</p>
            <p>So...</p>
            <p>The <a href="http://www.kboards.com/index.php/topic,149634.100.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussion in
                    this thread, where I posted about the <b>need for money</b> (resources) as <b>the real secret behind cumulative
                        success</b> (given all other factors in place such as a well written, well produced book)</a> got me further
                thinking...</p>
            <p><span style="color: #008000;">Supposing that we have a) <b>an excellent book to sell</b>, and b) <b>we have no
                        funds</b>, only our own efforts, skills and dedication... then, what can we poor church-mice do?</span></p>
            <p><b>Let's post below our methods, tips and tricks that can be used by anyone without spending a
                    cent.<br /></b><br />I'll start by listing some givens and things we already know, so we don't re-hash the
                same-old same-old.</p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><b>Methods We All Know Already (or Should
                        Know)<br /></b></span><br /><span style="color: #000000;"> 1) Write a <strong>high quality book</strong>
                    that people want to read.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">2) Have it <strong>professionally presented</strong> -- edited, designed, and with an
                    attractive cover (as much as possible for a church-mouse).</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">3) Use <strong>Social Media</strong> such as Facebook, Twitter, Goodreads,
                    LibraryThing, Shelfari, Pinterest, Google+, LinkedIn, MySpace, Tumbler, Instagram, etc., to promote your book to
                    your social circles. And this assumes you stay within limits of good behavior, don't spam, and use tactful
                    techniques to chronically cultivate your social networks. Use free HootSuite to set up automated tweets and
                    posts.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">4) Set up and cultivate a <strong>Mailing List</strong> for book announcements only
                    (via MailChimp or such), and post links and/or widgets with the subscription form in as many places as possible
                    and prominently on your website, blog, social media pages, and in the interior front and back matter of your
                    actual book.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">5) Include <strong>links to your other books</strong> or to a common landing page with
                    links inside each ebook front or back matter (or both).</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">6) <strong>Give away your book for free</strong> to build readership and gain fans. Use
                    the "Going Free" technique to either enroll the book in KDP Select and use the 5 free days to promote, or make
                    one of your books Perma-Free by price matching it (making it free on other sites via Smashwords, and have Amazon
                    match it).</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">7) Write a <strong>series</strong>, and put the first book Perma-Free as a loss leader
                    to "hook" them and gain buying fans for books 2, 3, and onwards.... The more books in the series, the more
                    likely you gain a long tail of "addicted" buyers.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">8.) <strong>Write more books</strong> (with quality and professional presentation a
                    given). Keep publishing them, and widening the net of your exposure, and have them sell each other.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">9) Use the various Going Free and Discounted <strong>promotion sites</strong> that
                    accept free submissions and fill out their forms, and hope to be picked up and featured.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">10) Cultivate <strong>reviews</strong>. Use LibraryThing Member Giveaways to give away
                    100 ebooks (at a time) to gain reviews. (Use Goodreads Giveaways to give away 1-3 hard copies of your hardcover
                    or paperback book, if you can afford it, but this is not free.) Find various forums and specialized groups on
                    Goodreads where you can offer your book to reviewers. Email bloggers directly and manually, one at a time, until
                    you lose the will to live as you comb the internet for them like precious crumbs.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">11) Find and cultivate <strong>Super-Fans</strong> who love your work with a passion
                    and will basically rave about your books for free to other people, which will in turn generate word-of-mouth and
                    a geometric progression for exposure.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">12) Cultivate yourself and/or your book series as a <strong>Brand</strong>.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">13) <strong>Band together</strong> with other church-mice. Join group blogs, blog hops,
                    and set up book tours. Plug each other!</span></p>

                    you used?</b></p>
